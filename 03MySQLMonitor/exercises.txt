1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

client (monitor) connects to server (which contains the data).
Clients connect to the server to perform database functions such as reading or storing data.
Client computer provides the user interaction facility (interface) and some or all application processing.
Server computer might provide storage, heavy data crunching, high res graphics...
Client requests content from server; servers await incoming requests.  Typically connected through a network but both may reside on same system.

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (Weâ€™ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

mysql> HELP SELECT
Name: 'SELECT'
Description:
Syntax:
SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
      [HIGH_PRIORITY]
      [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
      [SQL_SMALL_RESULT] [SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
      [SQL_CACHE | SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
    select_expr [, select_expr ...]
    [FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
    [HAVING where_condition]
    [ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ...]
    [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
    [PROCEDURE procedure_name(argument_list)]
    [INTO OUTFILE 'file_name' export_options
      | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name'
      | INTO var_name [, var_name]]
    [FOR UPDATE | LOCK IN SHARE MODE]]

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [HELP UNION], and
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/subqueries.html.

The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There
  must be at least one select_expr.

o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve
  rows. Its syntax is described in [HELP JOIN].

o The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions
  that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an
  expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The
  statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause.

  In the WHERE clause, you can use any of the functions and operators
  that MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary) functions. See
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/functions.html.

SELECT can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?

Interactive mode the user interacts with the server via the monitor (in my case Terminal), by typing in sql queries or MySQL commands at the MySQL prompt, and viewing the results.

In batch mode, a command or series of commands are stored in a file, read and executed by the server, in a batch, from the file.

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?

database option says which database to use

user (in conjunction with password) connects to the database as that user.  Different users have different permissions.

password authenticates the user, completes the connection.
